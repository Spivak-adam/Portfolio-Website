A Portfolio Web application utilizing the Mern (Mongoose, Express, React, Node). I am currently working to get the application online, but to use for now one must download repository and install the node modules.
To install dependencies:
./portfolio-root npm install
./portfolio-root/client npm install
./portfolio-root/server npm install

To start:
./portfolio-root npm start
